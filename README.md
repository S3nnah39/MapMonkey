# MapMonkey
Website that allows users to travel across different countries depending on the continent of their choice.

# Technologies used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript and the Google Map API.

# Challenges
1) For some time the team had issues connecting the domain name to the Repl.it. We first had our domain name as breaktime.online, however as we developed the web application, we opted to mapmonkey.tech .
2) Faced some trouble with formatting and resizing of elements.
